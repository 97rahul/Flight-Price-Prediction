# Flight Price Prediction
- A small project on ML deployment using Streamlit library in Python.
      

             



## Requirement

- To predict the fare of a flight from a source to destination on a particular date and time with different airlines and number of stops.
## Steps Involved

       1. Collection of data.
       2. Analysis and Preprocessing of data.
       3. EDA
       4. Feature Scaling if required.
       5. Featuring Selection
       6. Model Building
       7. Hyperparameter Tuning
       8. Deployment


## Description
        Data is imported to python environment where it is analysed and preprocessed.
        EDA, Feature scaling and selection is done where ever applicable.
        Model is built and trained using RandomForestRegressor.
        Validation Check is done using score,R2 score and RMSE.
        Hyperparameter Tuning is done using RandomizedSearchCV.
        RMSE and R2 score is checked for more accuracy.
        Finally it is serialized and deserialized using pickle and therefore deployed
        using Streamlit.
